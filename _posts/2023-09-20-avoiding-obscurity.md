In software development, "obscurity" typically refers to the practice of making code, algorithms, or system design difficult to understand or decipher. This can be done for various reasons, but most of them is due bad practice in software development, generally this is discouraged by community.

This involves writing code in a convoluted manner, using complex or unconventional syntax, variable names, or control structures that make it hard for others (or even oneself at a later date) to comprehend the logic or purpose of the code. Purposefully obscure code can be a security risk and is generally considered bad practice because it decrease maintainability and collaboration.
